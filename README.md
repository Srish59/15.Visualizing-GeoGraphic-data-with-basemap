Visualizing GeoGraphic data with basemap
Aim: To visualize the Geographic Data with Basemap.
Requirements: Python (jupyter notebook)
Description:
This is a basic example of visualizing geographic data using Basemap. You can customize the map projection, add more map features, and plot various types of data on the map. Basemap provides a wide range of functionality for working with geographic data, including shapefiles, annotations, and advanced map projections.
Basemap is deprecated as of Matplotlib 3.3, and its development has been stopped. It is recommended to use Cartopy, a successor to Basemap, for creating maps with Matplotlib.
Procedure:
1. Firstly, Installation of basemap using pip should be done.
2. Then, to import necessary libraries required for basemap visualization.
3. Then after,Create a Basemap instance.Later, add the map features like drawing coastlines, filling continents with color, drawing country boundaries, drawing meridians and parallels, and adding map title.
4. Nextly, Plot the data points on map by converting the coordinates to map projection.
5. Finally, Display the map using plt.show () function.
Basemap installation with pip command pip install basemap.
Result: Hence, The visualization of geographic data is done on Basemap
